first price sealed bid auctions on the ethereum blockchain

## Commitment Scheme 

First price sealed bid auctions are a kind of auction in which n participants are allowed to submit
sealed bids for some asset within a time frame as long as the bid is above a reserve price for that
asset. Bids are private and hidden from all the participants. It is analogous to collecting bids in
a sealed envelope, and waiting until after the auction is over to open each envelope and determine
the highest bidder.
