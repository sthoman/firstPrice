I. First Price Sealed Bid Auction

First price sealed bid auctions are a kind of auction in which n participants are allowed to submit
sealed bids for some some asset within a time frame as long as the bid is above a reserve price for 
that asset. Bids are private and shielded from all participants. It is analogous to collecting bids
in a sealed envelope, and waiting until after the auction is over to open each envelope and determine
the highest bidder. 

The simplest possible version of the auction contract will use a commit-and-reveal scheme where N market
participants submit a hash of their bid amount during the commitment phase of the auction. The commitment
phase of the auction will have a publicly defined start and end time. Once the commitment phase end time 
is reached, the auction will enter a reveal phase. The reveal phase will also have a publicly defined end 
time. During the reveal phase market participants shall submit their actual bid amounts and cryptographic
salt to a reveal() function. The reveal() function will hash the submitted bid amount from each participant
using their salt, and check if this hash is equivalent to the hash submitted by that same participant during 
the commitment phase of the auction. If the hashes match, the bid is valid. The contract will keep track 
of the highest bid as the reveal() function is called by each participant during the reveal phase. Once all
reveals are complete, the highest bidder can be determined on chain and an order can be signed and filled 
to complete the transaction. 

It will be necessary to determine how to properly incentivize honest actors and ensure all bidders submit
during the reveal phase. The intention of the protocol is to ensure participants cannot collude with each 
other regarding bidding and also are not influenced by knowledge of each others' bids until after the auction
enters the reveal phase (where bids can no longer be submitted). The purpose would be to determine the highest
possible fair market price for the auctioned asset. It will also be necessary to determine a solution for ties. 

II. Zero Knowledge Proofs

Will explore zero knowledge proofs as a way to prove the existence of a highest, winning bid, without
necessarily revealing any bid amounts. If ZKPs could also facilitate some basic KYC that would be of 
interest too. For instance, zero knowledge range proofs can prove that a persons current jurisdiction 
is within some range without necessarily revealing the jurisdiction itself. 

III. Secure Multi-party Computation

Multiple parties need to agree on a highest bid without necessarily revealing any of the bids to all 
parties. It might be possible to exploit homomorphic properties of encrypted values to determine the
highest bid on chain, without revealing them. This would be something interesting to research. 

For an MVP this may be overkill. In general the problem to solve is a problem of revealing a highest 
bid to all participants without revealing every bid. This wikipedia article discusses a case where a
group of participants determine the highest salary amongst them,

IV. 0x Protocol

Researching possible use of the 0x protocol to facilitate the auction.
