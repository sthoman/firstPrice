I. First Price Sealed Bid Auction

First price sealed bid auctions are a kind of auction in which n participants are allowed to submit
sealed bids for some some asset within a time frame as long as the bid is above a reserve price for 
that asset. Bids are private and hidden from all the participants. It is analogous to collecting bids
in a sealed envelope, and waiting until after the auction is over to open each envelope and determine
the highest bidder. 

The simplest version of the auction contract will use a commitment scheme where N market participants 
submit a hash of their bid amount during the commitment phase of the auction. The commitment phase of 
the auction will have a publicly defined start and end time. Once the commitment phase end time is 
reached, the auction will enter a reveal phase. The reveal phase will also have a publicly defined end 
time that must be greater than the commitment phase end time. During the reveal phase market participants 
shall submit their true bid amounts and cryptographic salt to a reveal() function. The reveal() function 
will hash the true bid amount from each participant using their own unique salt value, and check if this 
hash is equivalent to the hash submitted by that same participant during the commitment phase of the auction.
It is vitally important that participants' salt values remain secret prior to the reveal phase of the auction. 

If the resultant hashes match, the bid is valid. The contract will track the highest bid as the reveal() 
function is called by each participant during the reveal phase. Once all reveals are complete, the highest
bidder can be determined on chain and an order can be signed and filled to complete the transaction. 

It will be necessary to determine how to properly incentivize honest actors and ensure all bidders 
submit during the reveal phase. The intention of the protocol is to ensure participants cannot collude 
with each other regarding bidding and also are not influenced by knowledge of each others' bids until 
after the auction enters the reveal phase (where bids can no longer be submitted). The purpose would 
be to determine the highest possible fair market price for the auctioned asset. It will also be  
necessary to determine a solution for ties. 

II. Escrow of Funds

Each participants that commits to a bid during the commitment phase shall also be required to escrow a 
certain amount of funds for the duration of the auction. This is to give the seller assurance that the 
bidder can cover their bid in the event they win the auction. This needs to be investigated more. 

III. Zero Knowledge Proofs

Will explore zero knowledge proofs as a way to prove the owner of the highest, winning bid, without
necessarily revealing all bid amounts or bidders' identifying information. If ZKPs could be used to
facilitate some basic KYC rules that would be of interest too. For instance, zero knowledge range 
proofs can prove that an end users' current jurisdiction is within some range without necessarily 
revealing the jurisdiction itself or other identifying information about the end user. 

IV. Secure Multi-party Computation

Multiple parties need to agree on a highest bid without necessarily revealing any of the bids to all 
parties. It might be possible to exploit homomorphic properties of encrypted values to determine the
highest bid on chain, without revealing them. This would be something interesting to research. 

For an MVP this may be overkill. In general the problem to solve is a problem of revealing a highest 
bid to all participants without revealing every bid. This wikipedia article discusses a case where a
group of participants determine the highest salary amongst them,

V. 0x Protocol

Researching possible use of the 0x protocol to facilitate the auction.
