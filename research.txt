General Notes and Project Research

I. 

First price sealed bid auctions are a kind of auction in which n participants are allowed to submit
sealed bids for some some asset within a time frame as long as the bid is above a reserve price for 
that asset. Bids are private and shielded from all participants. It is analogous to collecting bids
in a sealed envelope, and waiting until after the auction is over to open each envelope and determine
the highest bidder. 

II. Zero Knowledge Proofs

Will explore zero knowledge proofs as a way to prove the existence of a highest, winning bid, without
necessarily revealing any bid amounts. If ZKPs could also facilitate some basic KYC that would be of 
interest too. For instance, zero knowledge range proofs can prove that a persons current jurisdiction 
is within some range without necessarily revealing the jurisdiction itself.

III. Secure Multi-party Computation

Multiple parties need to agree on a highest bid without necessarily revealing any of the bids to all 
parties. It might be possible to exploit homomorphic properties of encrypted values to determine the
highest bid on chain, without revealing them. This would be something interesting to research. 

IV. 0x Protocol

Researching possible use of the 0x protocol to faciliate the auction.
